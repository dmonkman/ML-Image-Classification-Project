# ML-Image-Classification-Project
A basic machine learning project. The purpose is to train and test algorithms capable of classifying different lego shapes. Uses python notebook and SKLearn libraries.

Image files not included as they are large (~160MB). If you really want to run it yourself just ask me for the image files and I can provide them.
